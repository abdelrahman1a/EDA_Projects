# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on three distinct datasets:
1. **Google Play Score**: Analyzing app ratings, reviews, and categories on the Google Play Store.
2. **Flight Price**: Analyzing flight pricing trends, airlines, and routes.
3. **Wine**: Analyzing wine quality, chemical properties.

The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights from each dataset to support data-driven decision-making.
